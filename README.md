# driver-knowledge-test
Original 2001 pure-javascript Demonstration Driver Knowledge Test, as used by the Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW.

This was the actual page/app used by many thousands of Australians when practising for the Driver Knowledge Test in order to get the Learner's Licence. Users could run the test online, or download the complete ZIP and run it on their own machines. (See https://web.archive.org/web/20020403091023/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/licensing/ae11_c.htm)

The page/app was a simulation of the mainframe application, with a dedicated touchscreen interface, that was used in NSW Motor Registries to administer the actual test.

This version fom 2001 was written by Lee Borkman in pure JavaScript. It's essentially a Single Page Application using 100% images in a fixed layout to implement the test interface, and replicating the substantial business logic used in the real test.

This 2001 JavaScript app does start up in modern browsers, but the interface is currently non-functional. I plan to make the minimum changes necessary to get the app to execute in modern browsers, and keep it is a historical curiosity.

To run the app, simply open "intro.htm" in  a browser, and click "Run the Demonstration Test"

With thanks to the (former) Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales.
