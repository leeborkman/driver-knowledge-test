Original 1999 pure-javascript Demonstration Driver Knowledge Test, as used by the Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW. Uploaded here for posterity's sake, and as a demonstration of ancient technology ;-)

**NOTE: this code is copyright:  Â© Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW), 02 December 1999**  

**NOTE 2: *The Roads and Traffic Authority* no longer exists. It was merged into *Roads and Maritime Services* several years ago, and now *Roads and Maritime Services* has been absorbed into *Transport New South Wales***

You can see it running at http://bjork.net/ddkt/ddkt.htm (click on "Run the Demonstration Test")

This was the actual page/app used by literally millions of Australians when practising for the Driver Knowledge Test in order to get the Learner's Licence. Users could run the test online, or download the complete ZIP and run it on their own machines. (See https://web.archive.org/web/20020403091023/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/licensing/ae11_c.htm)

The page/app was a simulation of the mainframe application, with a dedicated touchscreen interface, that was used in NSW Motor Registries to administer the actual test.

This 1999 app was written by Lee Borkman in pure JavaScript. It's essentially a Single Page Application using 100% images in a fixed layout to implement the test interface, and replicating the substantial business logic used in the real test. this was written before jQuery, and long before Angular, React, etc. It was also writte before smart-phones, so it's designed to be run in a fixed-width window on the desktop. 

The app was available on the RTA site, without substantial modification, for about 10 years. Over that time, it was run approximately 5 million times. Eventually it was replaced with a special connection to the actual mainframe application itself.

This 1999 code does still start up and run in modern browsers, so here it is, an historical curiosity if nothing more.

To run the app, simply open "ddkt.htm" in  a browser, and click "Run the Demonstration Test"

With thanks to the (former) Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales.
